      <p className="aboutme-desc">
        I'm a passionate and driven Full-Stack developer based in Port Saint Lucie, Florida.
      </p>
      <p>
        My love for technology started early, sparked by interests in video games, art design, 
        and networking. Over time, this passion evolved into mastering the exciting and ever-evolving field of Full-Stack development.
        This portfolio is a reflection of my skills, expertise, and experiences in web development. 
        Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to explore my work!
